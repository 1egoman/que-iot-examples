**Thing vs Service**

A thing does an action in real life (ex: printing something to terminal or watering a plant)
while a service receives and processes data for things or api clients to possibly use.

**exampleThing**

This is a simple thing that echos what's typed into the box in Que's dashboard to the terminal when the user presses a button.
